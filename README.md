# Project : M2-Capstone-Project-Hotel-Booking-Analysis-project-by-Ankit-Raj - EDA

**Overview**

The Hotel Booking Analysis project involves conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to uncover insights and trends. 

The goal is to understand customer booking patterns, preferences, and behaviors to enhance decision-making for hotel management and marketing strategies.

**Key Features**

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to prepare a clean dataset for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the dataset with measures such as mean, median, and mode to understand the central tendency and dispersion of the data.

Visualizations: Creating various plots (histograms, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, heatmaps) to visualize the distribution, relationships, and trends within the data.

Correlation Analysis: Examining the relationships between different variables to identify significant correlations.

Seasonality and Trends: Analyzing booking patterns over time to detect seasonal trends and peak booking periods.

Customer Segmentation: Identifying distinct customer segments based on booking behavior and demographics.

**Technologies Used**

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

**Model Performance**

As this project is focused on EDA, the performance metrics are not applicable. The primary objective is to derive meaningful insights rather than building predictive models.

However, any future predictive models developed from the insights gained would be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Future Enhancements**

Predictive Modeling: Developing machine learning models to predict booking cancellations, customer preferences, and occupancy rates.

Real-Time Analytics: Implementing real-time data processing to provide up-to-date insights for hotel management.

Advanced Segmentation: Utilizing clustering algorithms for more sophisticated customer segmentation.

Recommendation System: Building a recommendation engine to suggest personalized offers and promotions to customers.

**Contributions**

Data Collection: Team members who gathered and compiled the hotel booking data.

Data Cleaning: Contributors who worked on preprocessing and cleaning the data.

Visualization and Analysis: Analysts who created visualizations and conducted the exploratory data analysis.

Documentation: Individuals responsible for documenting the analysis process and findings.
